<h1><span style="color: #000080;">Open a Word Document</span></h1>
<p>Before you can make changes to a saved document, you must open it. If the Start screen appears when you open Word, a list of the documents you most recently worked on appears along the left side of the window. If the document you want is on the list, click the document name to open it; otherwise, click Open Other Documents at the bottom of the list to display the Open screen. This is the same screen that appears when you click File and then Open from within Word. You can use this screen to open your document.</p>
<p>If you are in Word, you click File and then choose Open to open a saved document. Documents you have recently used appear on the Recent Documents list. If the document you want to open is not on the list and you stored it on your computer&rsquo;s hard drive or on SkyDrive, you need to choose Computer or select your SkyDrive account to locate the document. Recent folders appear on the right side of the window, along with a Browse option. To find a document you recently used, look in the list of recent folders; use the Browse option to search all of the folders on your computer or use the Browse option to search all of the folders on SkyDrive.</p>
