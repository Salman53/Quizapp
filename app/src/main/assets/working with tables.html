<p>We assume you are familiar with how to create a spreadsheet program; you can construct your word cell formula. Word formulae uses a reference system to refer to an individual table cells. Each column is identified by a letter, starting with A for the first column, B for the second column, and so on. After the letter comes the row number. Thus, the first cell in the first row is A1, the third cell in the fourth row is C4, and so on.</p>
<p>Following are useful points to help you in constructing a word cell formula.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>S.No</th>
<th>Cell References and Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>A single cell reference, such as B3 or F7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>A range of cells, such as A4:A9 or C5:C13</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>A series of individual cells, such as A3, B4, C5</td>
