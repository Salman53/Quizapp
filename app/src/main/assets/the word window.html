<h1><span style="color: #000080;">The Word Window</span></h1>
<p>You use the Word window to interact with Word&mdash;you type your text into the window and you use the window to tell Word what to do. Here I will explain the parts of the Word window.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Quick Access Toolbar:</strong>&nbsp;In the upper-left corner of the window is the Quick Access toolbar, sometimes referred to as the QAT. The Quick Access Toolbar provides commands you frequently use. Save, Undo, and Redo appear on the toolbar by default. Click Save to save your file, Undo to roll back an action you have taken, and Redo to reapply an action you have rolled back.</p>
<p><strong>B&nbsp;Title Bar:</strong>&nbsp;In the top center of the window to the right of the Quick Access toolbar is the Title bar. The Title Bar displays the title of your document. Word names the first new document you open Document1. As you open additional new documents, Word names them sequentially. When you save a document, you assign the document a new name.</p>
