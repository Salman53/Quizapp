<h1><span style="color: #000080;">Save a Word Document to OneDrive</span></h1>
<p>OneDrive is a way to store your files online. This is often referred to as storing files in the cloud. When you store a file online, you can access it from anywhere, using such devices as laptop computers, desktop computers, mobile phones, or tablet PCs. Before you can use OneDrive, you must have a OneDrive account. You may already have one. OneDrive is part of Windows Live, so if you have any type of Windows Live account, such as Hotmail or Xbox LIVE, you have a OneDrive account. If you do not have a Windows Live account, you can sign up for OneDrive free by going to http://onedrive.live.com or by using the Sign In option under the Account option in Backstage view. Once you have an account, you can save your files to OneDrive. All you have to do to access them is log in to OneDrive.</p>
<p>OneDrive also gives you access to the Word Web App. The Word Web App is sort of a mini-Word you can use to create and modify Word files. The Web App does not have all the features of Word but it does have the key features and for the most part, they work the same as in Word. As you learn Word, you are also learning how to use the Web App.</p>
