<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;">Entering Text - Microsoft Word 2010</span></h1>
<p>In this chapter, let us discuss how to enter text with Microsoft Word 2010. Let us see how easy it is to enter text in a Word document. We assume you know that when you start Word, it displays a new document by default as shown below &minus;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: #000080;"><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/word/images/enter_text.jpg" alt="Enter Text" /></span></span></p>
<p>Document area is the area where you type your text. The flashing vertical bar is called the insertion point and it represents the location where the text will appear when you type. keep the cursor at the text insertion point and start typing the text. We typed only two words "Hello Word" as shown below. The text appears to the left of the insertion point as you type &minus;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: #000080;"><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/word/images/hello_word.jpg" alt="Hello Word" /></span></span></p>
<p>The following are the two important points that will help you while typing &minus;</p>
<p>You do not need to press Enter to start a new line. As the insertion point reaches the end of the line, Word automatically starts a new one. You will need to press Enter, to add a new paragraph.</p>
<p>When you want to add more than one space between words, use the Tab key instead of the spacebar. This way you can properly align text by using the proportional fonts.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;">Move Around in Word 2010</span></h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss how to move around in Word 2010. Word provides a number of ways to move around a document using the mouse and the keyboard.</p>
<p>To begin with, let us create some sample text. To create a sample text, there is a short cut available. Open a new document and type =<strong>rand()</strong>&nbsp;and press Enter. Word will create the following content for you &minus;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: #000080;"><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/word/images/word_sample_text.jpg" alt="Word Sample Text" /></span></span></p>
<h2>Moving with Mouse</h2>
<p>You can easily move the insertion point by clicking in your text anywhere on the screen. There may be instances when a document is big and you cannot see a place where you want to move. Here, you will have to use the scroll bars, as shown in the following screenshot &minus;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: #000080;"><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/word/images/word_scroll_bars.jpg" alt="Word Scroll Bars" /></span></span></p>
<p>You can scroll through your document by rolling your mouse wheel, which is equivalent to clicking the up-arrow or down-arrow buttons in the scroll bar.</p>
<h2>Moving with Scroll Bars</h2>
<p>As shown in the above screenshot, there are two scroll bars: one for moving vertically within the document, and one for moving horizontally. Using the vertical scroll bar, you may &minus;</p>
<p>Move upward by one line by clicking the upward-pointing scroll arrow.</p>
<p>Move downward by one line by clicking the downward-pointing scroll arrow.</p>
<p>Move one next page, using the next page button (footnote).</p>
<p>Move one previous page, using the previous page button (footnote).</p>
<p>Use the&nbsp;<strong>Browse Object</strong>&nbsp;button to move through the document, going from one chosen object to the next.</p>
<h2>Moving with Keyboard</h2>
<p>The following keyboard commands, used for moving around your document, also move the insertion point &minus;</p>
