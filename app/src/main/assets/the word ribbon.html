<h1><span style="color: #000080;">The Word Ribbon</span></h1>
<p>You use commands to tell Microsoft Word what to do. In Microsoft Word 2013, you use the Ribbon to issue commands. The Ribbon is located near the top of the window, below the Quick Access toolbar and the Title bar.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Tabs:</strong>&nbsp;At the top of the Ribbon are several tabs. Clicking a tab displays several command groups.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Command Groups:</strong>&nbsp;A command group is a group of related command buttons. Each tab has several command groups.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Command Buttons:</strong>&nbsp;You click command buttons to issue commands or to access menus and dialog boxes. Menus and dialog boxes provide additional options and/or commands.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Dialog Box Launcher:</strong>&nbsp;You may find a dialog box launcher in the bottom-right corner of a command group. Click the dialog box launcher to see additional commands in a dialog box or pane.</p>

<h2>Galleries</h2>
<p><img class="alignCenter picSize" title="styles gallery" src="C:\Users\aqibj\AndroidStudioProjects\MicrosoftWordLearning\app\src\main\assets\word-gallery.png" alt="styles gallery" width="500" height="257" /></p>
<p>When you select a Ribbon option, Word may present a gallery. A gallery is a set of options. When you hover over an option, Word provides a live preview of how your document will appear if you select that option. For example, if you press the down-arrow in the Styles group, Word presents a gallery of styles. If you hover over a style, any text you have selected appears in that style. If you select the style, Word reformats your selections to that style.</p>
<h2>Pin the Ribbon</h2>
<p>As you work, the Ribbon can be either pinned or unpinned. When the Ribbon is pinned, tabs and command groups are visible. If the Ribbon is pinned, you can unpin it. When the Ribbon is unpinned, you can see the tabs but not the command groups&mdash;when you click on a tab, the command groups appear. If the Ribbon is unpinned, you can pin it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
