<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;">Zoom In-Out in Word 2010</span></h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss how to zoom in and zoom out in Word 2010. Microsoft Word provides a functionality to apply zoom-in and zoom-out operations on a document. When we apply the zoom-in operation, it enlarges the size of text whereas applying the zoom-out operation reduces the size of text.</p>
<p>A zoom operation just changes the size of the font on-screen without impacting any other attribute of the document. You can apply the zoom operation in various ways as explained in this chapter.</p>
<h2>Zoom-in &amp; Zoom-out using view tab</h2>
<p>Here is the simple procedure to apply the zoom-in or the zoom-out operations using the View tab &minus;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Click the&nbsp;<strong>View</strong>&nbsp;tab and then click the&nbsp;<strong>Zoom</strong>&nbsp;button as shown below.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/word/images/zoom_button.jpg" alt="Zoom Button" /></span></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>&nbsp;&minus; When you click the&nbsp;<strong>Zoom</strong>&nbsp;button, a Zoom dialog box will appear as shown below. This will display the zoom options box to select a value to reduce or increase the size of the document on-screen. By default, it will be 100%; you can select 200% to increase the size of the font or 75% to reduce the size of the font.</p>
<p>You can click the&nbsp;<strong>Many pages</strong>&nbsp;down arrow and select to display multiple pages.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/word/images/zoom_options.jpg" alt="Zoom Options" /></span></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Once you are done with selecting an option, click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>&nbsp;to apply the changes on the document.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Try different options available, for example&nbsp;<strong>Page Width</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Text Width</strong>.</p>
<h2>Zoom-in &amp; Zoom-out using (+) and (-) Buttons</h2>
<p>The following screenshot shows two buttons&nbsp;<strong>Zoom-out</strong>&nbsp;which is the&nbsp;<strong>(-)</strong>&nbsp;button and&nbsp;<strong>Zoom-in</strong>&nbsp;which is the&nbsp;<strong>(+)</strong>&nbsp;button.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/word/images/zoom_button2.jpg" alt="Zoom Button 2" /></span></p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Click the&nbsp;<strong>Zoom-out</strong>&nbsp;button, you will find that your document size will decrease by 10% each time you click the button. Similar way, if you click on&nbsp;<strong>Zoom-in</strong>&nbsp;button your document size will increase by 10% each time you click the button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Try this simple operation with different values to see the difference. The above screenshot shows 140% zoom-in view of the document.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;">Special Symbols in Word 2010</span></h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss the use of special symbols in Word 2010. Your keyboard may not have many characters available but you want to use those characters in your document; in such situations, you have the option to insert&nbsp;<strong>Special Symbols</strong>&nbsp;the way we will further understand in this chapter.</p>
<p>To insert symbols that are occasionally used, follow the steps in this section. If you find yourself using a particular symbol frequently, you can assign a keyboard shortcut to it.</p>
<h2>Insert Special Symbols</h2>
<p>Here is a simple procedure to apply zoom-in or zoom-out operation using the View tab &minus;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>&nbsp;&minus; To insert a special symbol, bring your cursor at the place where you want to insert the symbol. Click the&nbsp;<strong>Insert</strong>&nbsp;tab. You will find two options under the symbol button&nbsp;<strong>(a) Equation</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>(b) Symbols</strong>. Click either of these two options based on your requirement. You will further use equations while preparing mathematical or scientific or any similar document. For now, we are going to understand the use of the&nbsp;<strong>Symbol</strong>&nbsp;button as shown below.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/word/images/symbol_button.jpg" alt="Symbol Button" /></span></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>&nbsp;&minus; When you click the&nbsp;<strong>Symbol</strong>&nbsp;button, a small list of symbols will appear as shown below.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/word/images/symbol_box.jpg" alt="Symbol Box" /></span></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Now click on any of the available symbols in the box to insert that in your document at the selected location. If you do not find the desired symbol in this small box, then you can click at the&nbsp;<strong>More Symbols</strong>&nbsp;option to have a wide range of symbols as shown below in the symbol dialog box. You can select any of the symbol and then click the&nbsp;<strong>Insert</strong>&nbsp;button to insert the selected symbol.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/word/images/symbol_dialog_box.jpg" alt="Symbol Dialog Box" /></span></p>
<h2>Assign Shortcut Key</h2>
<p>You can assign a keyboard shortcut to type any of the available symbol. Following are the steps to assign&nbsp;<strong>Ctrl + Q</strong>&nbsp;key to insert the &copy; symbol which is one of the available symbols in the special symbols list &minus;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Assume you already have the following symbol dialog box opened.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/word/images/shortcut_key.jpg" alt="Shortcut Key" /></span></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Click the symbol for which a shortcut key needs to be assigned. Now click&nbsp;<strong>Shortcut Key</strong>&nbsp;button which will display the following&nbsp;<strong>Customize Keyboard</strong>&nbsp;dialog box.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/word/images/customize_keyboard.jpg" alt="Customize Keyboard" /></span></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Now type the selected shortcut key in the shortcut key box. You press&nbsp;<strong>Ctrl + Q</strong>&nbsp;and then click the&nbsp;<strong>Assign</strong>&nbsp;button to assign the shortcut key. You will see that the selected key will be added in the list of assigned keys. Finally, use the&nbsp;<strong>Close</strong>&nbsp;button to close the dialog box.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Now try to type&nbsp;<strong>Ctrl + Q</strong>&nbsp;using the keyboard directly and you will find that you are able to type &copy; symbol without going into the symbol dialog box.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;">Undo Changes in Word 2010</span></h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss how to undo and redo changes in Word 2010. Microsoft word provides two important features called the&nbsp;<strong>Undo</strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>Repeat</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Redo</strong>. The Undo feature is used to undo the previous action and the&nbsp;<strong>Repeat</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Redo</strong>&nbsp;feature is used to repeat the previous action.</p>
<p>For example, if you mistakenly delete text, you can use the&nbsp;<strong>Undo</strong>&nbsp;feature to recover it. In a similar way, if you delete a character and you want to delete more characters then you can use the&nbsp;<strong>Repeat</strong>&nbsp;operation.</p>
<h2>How to use Undo &amp; Repeat operations</h2>
<p>You can access the Undo and Repeat buttons from the Quick Access toolbar. You should make a note that the&nbsp;<strong>Repeat</strong>&nbsp;button is also called&nbsp;<strong>Redo</strong>&nbsp;button and both the operations have the same meaning.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/word/images/undo_button.jpg" alt="Undo and Repeat Buttons" /></span></p>
<p>Here is the simple procedure to apply&nbsp;<strong>undo</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>repeat</strong>&nbsp;(redo) operations &minus;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Let us type some text in a blank document. Now click the&nbsp;<strong>Repeat</strong>&nbsp;(Redo) button and you will see that Word will repeat the same operation for you.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/word/images/repeat_operation.jpg" alt="Repeat Operation" /></span></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Now to examine the&nbsp;<strong>undo</strong>&nbsp;operation, let us delete the last word&nbsp;<strong>operation</strong>&nbsp;character by character so that you have the following text remaining in the line.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/word/images/undo_operation.jpg" alt="Undo Operation" /></span></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Let us try to click the&nbsp;<strong>Undo</strong>&nbsp;button one by one. You will see that Word will recover all the deleted characters one by one after performing a few undo operations.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/word/images/undo_operation2.jpg" alt="Undo Operation2" /></span></p>
<h2>Shortcuts to use Undo &amp; Repeat operations</h2>
<p>Though you can access the&nbsp;<strong>Undo</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Repeat</strong>&nbsp;commands from the Quick Access toolbar, but because these commands are the most frequently used commands, we recommend you memorize their keyboard shortcuts which are as follows &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>S.No</th>
<th>Shortcuts &amp; Operation</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>
<p><strong>Ctrl + Z</strong></p>
<p>Undoes the previous action.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>
<p><strong>Ctrl + Y</strong></p>
<p>Repeats the previous action.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Note that if the previous action was Undo,&nbsp;<strong>Ctrl+Y</strong>&nbsp;redoes the Undone action.</p>
